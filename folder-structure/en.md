Here is a Unix-based operating system directory structure in markdown format, with usage of folders in different distros and images:

```

## Common Directories

- `/` (root): The top-level directory of the filesystem hierarchy.
- `/bin`: Essential command binaries (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`).
  - In Ubuntu and Debian, `/bin` is a symlink to `/usr/bin`.
- `/sbin`: Essential system binaries (e.g., `init`, `ifconfig`, `route`).
  - In Ubuntu and Debian, `/sbin` is a symlink to `/usr/sbin`.
- `/etc`: Host-specific system-wide configuration files.
  - In Red Hat and CentOS, network scripts are stored in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/`.
- `/dev`: Device files (e.g., `/dev/null`, `/dev/sda`).
- `/proc`: Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information.
- `/var`: Variable files (e.g., logs, spool files, and temporary files).
  - In Ubuntu, the default Apache document root is `/var/www/html/`.
- `/tmp`: Temporary files. Often not preserved between system reboots.
- `/usr`: User utilities and applications.
  - In Arch Linux, the pacman package cache is stored in `/var/cache/pacman/pkg/`.
- `/home`: User home directories.
  - In Ubuntu and Debian, each user has a directory named `/home/username/`.
- `/boot`: Boot loader files, kernel, and initrd.
  - In Fedora, the GRUB configuration file is `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg`.
- `/lib`: Essential shared libraries and kernel modules.
  - In Ubuntu and Debian, `/lib` is a symlink to `/usr/lib`.
- `/opt`: Optional application software packages.
- `/mnt`: Temporarily mounted filesystems.
- `/media`: Mount points for removable media (e.g., USB drives, CDs).
  - In Ubuntu, a USB drive might be mounted at `/media/username/USBDRIVE/`.

## Distro-Specific Directories

### Ubuntu and Debian
- `/snap`: Snap packages (Ubuntu only).
- `/usr/share/doc`: Documentation for installed packages.

### Red Hat, Fedora, and CentOS
- `/usr/local`: Locally installed software.
- `/usr/libexec`: System daemons and system utilities.

### Arch Linux
- `/srv`: Data for services provided by the system.
- `/run`: Information about the running system since the last boot.

Remember, the exact structure and usage may vary between different Unix-based operating systems and distributions.
