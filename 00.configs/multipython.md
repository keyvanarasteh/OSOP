Adding different Python versions to PyCharm allows you to work with multiple Python environments in your projects. Here's how you can set up multiple Python versions in PyCharm:

1. Install multiple Python versions:
   First, ensure you have the desired Python versions installed on your system. You can use tools like pyenv or deadsnakes PPA to install multiple Python versions.

   For example, using deadsnakes PPA:
   ```
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3.8 python3.9 python3.10
   ```

2. Open PyCharm and your project.

3. Set up virtual environments:
   It's a good practice to use virtual environments for each project. Here's how to create them:

   a. Open the Terminal in PyCharm (View -> Tool Windows -> Terminal)
   b. Create a virtual environment for each Python version:
      ```
      python3.8 -m venv venv38
      python3.9 -m venv venv39
      python3.10 -m venv venv310
      ```

4. Configure PyCharm to use these environments:
   a. Go to File -> Settings (on Windows/Linux) or PyCharm -> Preferences (on macOS)
   b. Navigate to Project: YourProjectName -> Python Interpreter
   c. Click the gear icon next to the Python Interpreter dropdown
   d. Select "Add"
   e. Choose "Existing Environment"
   f. Browse to the `bin/python` (or `Scripts\python.exe` on Windows) file in each of your virtual environments
   g. Add each environment

5. Switch between Python versions:
   You can now easily switch between Python versions for your project:
   a. Open the Python Interpreter settings as in step 4
   b. Select the desired interpreter from the dropdown menu

6. For different Python versions in different run configurations:
   a. Go to Run -> Edit Configurations
   b. Add a new configuration or edit an existing one
   c. In the "Python interpreter" section, select the specific interpreter for this run configuration

```

This diagram shows the steps to switch Python interpreters in PyCharm.

Remember, when working on different projects, it's a good practice to create separate virtual environments for each project to manage dependencies effectively.
